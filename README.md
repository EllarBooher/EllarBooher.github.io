# EllarBooher.github.io
This repository hosts a showcase of my portfolio projects, hosted at https://ellarbooher.github.io/ via github pages.

The npm package [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) was used to help deploy.

The source of the webpages lives on `main`, while the deployed build is on a separate branch `gh-pages`.
